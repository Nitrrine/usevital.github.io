    <b> There's nothing (of note) here... </b>
    <br>
    Due to limitations GitHub imposes when using Pages, we don't host most of our stuff here.
    <br>
    Instead, the following links can be used to go to our actual projects:
    <br>
    Vital, the modpack, can be found on <a href="https://modrinth.com/modpack/vital">Modrinth</a> and <a href="https://github.com/intergrav/vital">GitHub</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    NotEssential can be found <a href="https://notessential.blurry.gay/">here</a>. The source code of the site can be found <a href="https://github.com/usevital/notessential">here</a>.
    <br>
    Its associated gallery is located in <a href="https://notessentialsite.github.io/gallery">/gallery subpage</a> of this redirect site.
    <br>
    <br>
    Translator's source code and releases can be found on <a href="https://github.com/usevital/translator">GitHub</a>. Ward can be found <a href="ward.worldwidepixel.ca">here</a> and its source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/usevital/ward">here</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    Bulb, the guides, will be available soon!
